# What is RoulEAT

RoulEAT is a webapp that allows users to randomly select a cuisine to eat, and provides them with matching options based off of their location. RoulEAT was created by Jeremy Cook and William Watson.

## What does it use?

RoulEAT is built using React, TypeScript, Nodejs, React Icons and React Query. It also uses Yelps API to access restaurant information based on location.

### How does it work?

1. Enter your location upon entering the site
2. Spin the wheel
3. Browse through the options based on the result

### WEBSITE/PROJECT LINK STILL BEING WORKED ON

The idea behind RoulEAT came from all the times people would not know what they wanted to eat, only what they didn't want. With RoulEAT, the only thing the user has to do is spin a wheel, and the rest is left up to chance.

### How to contact us

Github and LinkedIn information will go here, and will also be on the site itself.
